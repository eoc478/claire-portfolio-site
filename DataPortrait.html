    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>For this project, I had to track data for a week and animate it through classes. I chose to visualize my sleep schedule through counting sheep. Click to start and cycle through the days. The amount of sheep that jump over the fence is the amount of hours I slept that night.</p>
