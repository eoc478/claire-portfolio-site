<h2>Reflections on Critical Computation Fall 2024:</h2>
<p>I started off a little critical (no pun intended!) of p5.js. Because I was so new to everything, I didn't fully understand what p5.js could do. With the first project, I thought p5.js was just shapes and colors and not really anything special compared to Google Drawings or Illustrator. With each project, I was able to learn more about not only p5.js but coding in general. I feel like I have become a better problem solver. ADD MORE LATER</p>
